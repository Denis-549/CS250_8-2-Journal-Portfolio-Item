How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

1.	Approaching all requests from an end user point of view rather than a solution-based or technical approach helps to give a better understanding as to what the user is seeking to achieve. Identifying exactly what we are trying to achieve, establishing requirements and categorizing them based on the goal of the program. Establishing the right technique to go about gathering those requirements as well as translating them into clear, short and concise user stories and/or tasks. Having as many discussions about what, who and how the program deliverable will be achieved, as well as associated requirements. Noting user needs in a well-formatted manner, or in a form of commotion list. The process of interpretation will include feasibility study(s), requirement gathering, creating a business requirement document, a software requirement specification document, as well as validation for the requirements. The user requirements will discuss and address all the various aspects of program unambiguously by writing and documenting aspects to determine the best project path. Requirement prioritization and grooming will follow. Mock-ups will then be reviewed. The process flow diagram and showing basic features of the program is developed with minimal features that details steps from start to end. Additional discussion and/or verification on any features and enhancements based on priorities. 


A user story provide a solid basis for communication and collaboration focusing on establishing cross-team clarity on what matters most to the user in other words what to build. It also helps to emphasize verbal communication especially in requirement gathering process. It is an informal and simple way to translate ideas, requests and complex issues, features of a program or software into a discussion-like language description. It helps to write down how a project (Agile Software Development Life Cycle) will deliver value back to the end user. It also describes parts or features of a software in a way that empowers meaningful product discussions within the agile team and the internal/external stakeholders. User stories help to deviate from writing about the requirements to discussions about them. It reduces the time spent on writing large documentations as well as it also saves time in developing qualities software. It is simply a conversation channel between the client and the development team.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

2.	Having a clear picture of what to build, for whom, why, and when is essential to finding the right approach to develop a program. Using the right development methodology based on the nature and scope of the project helps to drive true value, eliminate inefficiencies, minimize risks (such as cost overruns, bugs, and changing requirements). A process of unambiguous requirement gathering before any kind of software development process begins should also be in place. The development team should be empowered to decide the software development model best suited for the development process. Commonly used models include iterative, waterfall, prototype or agile model and others.

Agile software development process has five (5) common methods used in software development, namely Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming, Lean Development, and Crystal. Based on my experience, scrum is the one method that incorporates all of the aspects that make a software development project successful. Scrum embraces feature driven development, frequent inspection and adaptation much more than most agile methods. It encourages accountability, teamwork, self-organization, and learning through experience and it is aligned towards a business approach where external stakeholders are included in all development processes.
